# Economist & Big Data

Big data is a humbling experience. Even as a Ph.D. student at a top research university, there are barriers to entry into Big Data. Nevertheless, I tried to break into this field by obtaining many training certificates on LinkedIn and finally decided to learn Spark to manage extensive data. I wish this had been taught in an economics program during my first year, so here I am, advising my fellow readers. So gear up because this might be a doozy! 

The academic in me resist writing this paragraph, but I'd like my readers to know what's ahead. I'll begin with a brief introduction to what Spark (and PySpark) really is and give some reasoning as to why I chose this method for managing my data. Then, I will walk you through the struggles that every single scraped data available online usually faces and describe some troubleshooting you can do to help you get out of the pickle. Lastly, I'll conclude with some resources and training that I did that might help you since each use case is different.
