This paper investigates early convergence dynamics of reinforcement learning pricing algorithms amidst firm competition, focusing on adjustments to annealing schedules, competition strategies, and hyperparameters. Employing Q-learning, the study
explores the optimization of the net present value of expected future rewards, revealing
insights into the impact of various parameters on convergence. Findings highlight the
dominance of firms with higher capacity, the potential for stable results with fewer
interactions, and the influence of annealing schedules on convergence speed and stability. The research contributes to understanding the complexities of AI-driven pricing in
competitive markets, offering implications for algorithm design and regulatory frameworks.
