This study identifies the causal effect of acquiring funding on Kickstarter, which has become a common method for "new‚Äù entrepreneurs to acquire financial support. Subsequently, it studies gender-based heterogeneity in acquiring funding on future outcomes for first time entrepreneurs. The study employs a regression discontinuity design to address the issue of non-random assignment of first campaigns run by entrepreneurs. According to the findings, successfully completing the first Kickstarter campaign results in an increase of 32% compared to the mean funding received after the first campaign. For female entrepreneurs, successfully completing their first project yields a smaller increase of $2,961 in raising funds via crowdfunding, as opposed to their female counterparts who fail to finish their campaigns. However, males see an increase of $4,018 which is a 40% increase compared to the mean funds raised in the future for all entrepreneurs and is statistically different than their female counterparts for a subset of the sample. This study adds to the literature on the determinants of successful entrepreneurs and highlights the need for further research to understand and address gender disparities in entrepreneurship.
