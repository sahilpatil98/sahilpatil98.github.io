Abstract: This study identifies the causal effect of acquiring funding on Kickstarter, which has become a standard method for "new‚Äù entrepreneurs to obtain financial support. Subsequently, it studies gender-based heterogeneity in acquiring funding for future outcomes for "first-time" entrepreneurs. The study employs a regression discontinuity design to address the issue of non-random assignment of an entrepreneur's success in the first campaign. According to the findings, completing the first Kickstarter campaign increased the first Kickstarter campaign, resulting in an increase of 32% compared to the mean funding received after the first campaign. For female entrepreneurs, completing their first project yields an increase of $2,961 in raising funds via crowdfunding, as opposed to their female counterparts who fail to finish their campaigns. However, males see a more significant increase of $4,018, which is a 40% increase compared to the mean funds raised in the future for all entrepreneurs. It is statistically different from their female counterparts for a sample subset. This study adds to the literature on the determinants of successful entrepreneurs and highlights the need for further research to understand and address gender disparities in entrepreneurship.
